Check-out/login system--
  Cannot access checkout normally, must go through cart to do so
  default -- cart page will be in one-time customer format
  log in -- Must be done on specific page due to time constraints, logging in will change the login area to a brief profile description. The checkout button on the cart will take you to a copy of the cart page that is in a logged in format.
  Registration -- will simply do the same thing as login because any more would be unnecessary for the moment.
  Checkout!!! --
