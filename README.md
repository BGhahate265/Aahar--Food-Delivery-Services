SLC Project


 Give your business a name and a logo.
Your service will have a variety of delivery options to meet the needs of different types of customers (i.e. meat, vegetarian, vegan, family, couples, gluten-free, etc.).
The website should clearly identify the target market locations and its product availability. --- put a few OUT OF STOCK labels on the menu, that should essentially count.
The website should allow customers to check availability of products,
\, place and pay for orders online as a one-time customer,
\, or become a member
  and set up plans for a calendar year.
 The site should also contain a contact page.

Check-out/login system--
  Cannot access checkout normally, must go through cart to do so
  default -- cart page will be in one-time customer format
  log in -- Must be done on specific page due to time constraints, logging in will change the login area to a brief profile description. The checkout button on the cart will take you to a copy of the cart page that is in a logged in format.
  Registration -- will simply do the same thing as login because any more would be unnecessary for the moment.
  Checkout!!! --
